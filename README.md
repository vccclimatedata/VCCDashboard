# Data-Witnesses-DAEN-Project
Data Witnesses Team Repository

Much of the Climate and Weather data that can be useful to the Virginia Climate Center, city and municipal planners, and future end users are not easily accessible, interpreted and summarized. This makes it hard for said users to make good decisions that impact the lives of current and future Virginians. 

The goal of the project is to combine, clean, summarize and visualize current and future climate and weather data so that decision makers can easily have access to useful informationâ€‹.
